		Everyday I take the “L” to get to school or to run errands. I can’t help but to get frustrated when you have to transfer lines multiple times to get to your destination. The process usually involves some back tracking and in some cases confusion. I wanted to develop a webpage to create this feeling. The webpage is an experiential page allowing the visitor to explore the site with the potential of getting lost. 
		I wanted each “stop” or page be symbolic of the station it was named after. So I took the name of each stop and put it into google image. I selected the top image or most viewed image to be the representation of that stop. This page can be seen an exploratory page.
